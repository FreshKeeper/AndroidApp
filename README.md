## About
FreshKeeper is a mobile application designed to help households effectively manage their food inventories and reduce waste through smart tracking of expiration dates. The app streamlines food management by integrating a barcode scanner, timely notifications, and organized inventory management. It provides users with real-time product information by integrating public APIs for enhanced food data, and features a modern, minimalist UI powered by Jetpack Compose.

### Features

- **Timely Notifications**: Receive alerts before food items expire.
- **Barcode Scanner Integration**: Quickly add products by scanning their barcode.
- **API-Driven Enhancements**: Retrieve detailed product information from public APIs.
- **Modern UI/UX**: Built with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose following the MVVM pattern for clean architecture.
- **Secure Multi-User Support**: User authentication via OAuth 2.0 with Firebase Authentication and robust data management using Firebase Firestore.
- **Continuous Integration & Delivery**: Automated testing and builds using GitHub Actions.
